The provided source files contain the PyTorch-based code for training fully-connected and convolutional networks using the following algorithms, as summarized in Fig. 1:
* the backpropagation of error algorithm (BP), 
* feedback alignment (FA) [Lillicrap et al., Nat. Comms., 2016],
* direct feedback alignment (DFA) [Nokland, NIPS, 2016],
* the **proposed direct random target projection (DRTP)** algorithm, which solves both the weight transport and the update locking problems.

In order to reproduce our experiments in the associated paper (see below), the error-sign-based variant of DFA (sDFA) and shallow learning are also available.

In case you decide to use the source code for academic or commercial use, we would appreciate if you let us know; **feedback is welcome**. Upon usage of the source code, **please cite the associated paper** (also available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01311.pdf)):
